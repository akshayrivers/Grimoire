/*
LSM Implementation in Rust
LSM- Log structured merge tree is a Self balancing tree like it can be Red-Black Tree , AVL Tree etc.
we will implement LSM using AVL Tree.
Basic design of AVL Tree:
1. It is a self balancing binary search tree.(It is a height balanced binary search tree)
2. The balance factor of a node is the height of the right subtree minus the height of the left subtree.It must be in the range of -1, 0, 1.
   [ balanceFactor = height(rightSubTree) - height(leftSubTree) ]
